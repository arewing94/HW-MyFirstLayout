  <p>I have always had a passion for knowledge on the why of human 
      behavior. I found that UX Research and UX Design to be one way to 
      quench my thirst for this knowledge. 
      
      I enjoy iterating research into user centered design, developing 
      informational architecture, as well as crafting simple UX writing to 
      help keep with the brand. The pieces in my portfolio featured below 
      highlight my ability to collect, analyze and synthesis information to 
      iterate the data into a digital product.</p>
